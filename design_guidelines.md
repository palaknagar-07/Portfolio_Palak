# Ocean-Themed Portfolio Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern portfolio sites like Linear, Notion, and Three.js showcase websites, combined with underwater/ocean aesthetics for a unique personal brand.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary (Ocean Depths)**:
- Primary: 220 85% 15% (Deep ocean blue)
- Secondary: 200 70% 25% (Midnight blue)
- Background: 220 50% 8% (Abyssal black-blue)

**Accent Colors**:
- Cyan highlights: 180 100% 70% (Bioluminescent cyan)
- Teal accents: 160 80% 60% (Coral teal)

**Light Mode (Surface Waters)**:
- Primary: 210 100% 95% (Ocean foam white)
- Secondary: 200 30% 85% (Light blue-gray)
- Background: 210 40% 98% (Pure white with blue hint)

### B. Typography
- **Primary**: Inter via Google Fonts (clean, modern)
- **Accent**: Orbitron via Google Fonts (tech/futuristic feel for name)
- Hierarchy: Name (48px bold), Section headers (32px), Body (16px), Captions (14px)

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Use units of 4, 8, 16, 24 for consistent rhythm
- Container max-width: 1200px
- Section padding: py-24, px-8
- Component spacing: gap-8, space-y-16

### D. Component Library

**Hero Section**:
- Full viewport height with 3D ocean background
- Floating particle animations
- Large typography with animated text reveals
- Subtle wave motion overlay

**Skill Jellyfish Cards**:
- Translucent cards with glowing borders
- Floating animation on hover
- Icon + skill name + proficiency indicator
- Bioluminescent glow effects

**Project Coral Reef**:
- Grid layout with interactive project cards
- Hover effects reveal project details
- Glowing accent borders
- Deep-link navigation to project details

**Contact Ocean Floor**:
- Form styled as underwater control panel
- Glowing input fields with cyan accents
- Animated submit button with ripple effects

### E. Animations
**Subtle Only**:
- Gentle floating motions for skill cards
- Smooth scroll-triggered reveals
- Particle drift animations
- Subtle parallax on hero background

## Visual Treatments

**Gradient Usage**:
- Hero background: Deep blue to black gradient (220 85% 15% to 220 50% 5%)
- Card overlays: Subtle cyan to transparent gradients
- Button highlights: Bioluminescent cyan gradients

**Interactive Elements**:
- Cards lift slightly on hover with glowing borders
- Buttons have subtle pulse animations
- Form inputs glow cyan on focus
- Smooth transitions (0.3s ease)

## Images
**Large Hero Background**: Yes - 3D rendered ocean scene or abstract underwater environment
**Project Thumbnails**: Screenshots/mockups of AI/ML projects with ocean-themed overlay treatments
**Skill Icons**: Use Heroicons or Material Icons with cyan color treatment
**Avatar/Profile**: Professional headshot with subtle underwater lighting effects

## Accessibility
- High contrast ratios maintained in both modes
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Reduced motion support for animations
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

This design balances technical professionalism with creative ocean theming, perfect for showcasing AI/ML expertise while standing out from typical developer portfolios.
